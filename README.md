### About Me

With 5 years of practical experience as a project manager and Scrum master in global, multinational teams, I'm transitioning my career to a technical role. As a Junior Cloud Engineer,
i've bilt my knowleage in AWS services, Linux, Python scripting, networking, and databases data, cloud infrastructure, and automation, managing both SQL and NoSQL databases, and my passion in data and analyzing.

📌 What I actually can bring with my hands on past expirience:

### Soft skils:
* 🔹 Facilitate key Agile ceremonies and guide the team in applying Scrum values, ensuring we’re not just doing Agile, but being Agile
* 🔹 Co-create roadmaps and delivery plans based on team capacity, product goals, and metrics — balancing the short-term sprint rhythm with the big-picture strategy
* 🔹 Write epics, user stories, and requirements that help align dev work with business value
* 🔹 Support the Product Owner in backlog prioritization, refinement, and stakeholder alignment
* 🔹 Foster team connection and psychological safety through regular 1:1s, retrospectives, and open conversations — because delivery follows trust
* 🔹 Track risks, dependencies, and delivery health — and proactively course-correct when needed

📈 What’s worked well and shown good results:
* 🔸 Created onboarding flows for new engineers that reduced ramp-up time and improved retention
* 🔸 Introduced metrics-driven planning and delivery retrospectives that helped teams improve sprint-over-sprint
* 🔸 Established a shared understanding of the product vision and technical roadmap between devs, POs, and stakeholders
* 🔸 Facilitated dozens of retrospectives and feedback loops to help teams reflect and continuously evolve
