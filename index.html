My role involves defining project scope, creating comprehensive plans, and managing the development lifecycle from start to finish. A key part of my work is prioritizing tasks and managing backlogs based on evolving requirements, especially within data science. I also handle staffing and resource allocation to ensure teams have what they need to succeed. I believe in proactive communication, and I make it a point to keep all stakeholders, including senior management, informed on project status and key milestones.

The Result
My goal is to drive continuous improvement and deliver results that support business growth. I'm passionate about turning a vision into a clear, executable plan and leading teams to achieve it.
